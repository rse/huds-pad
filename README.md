Abstract
--------

This is **HUDS Pad**, the attendee client-side web application
(for desktop and mobile devices) for interacting with a live video-streaming session
leveraging [Dr. Ralf S. Engelschall](https://engelschall.com)'s
[Head-Up-Display Server (HUDS)](https://github.com/rse/huds) and its
[Training HUD](https://github.com/rse/huds-hud-training).

It allows attendees to anonymously send textual messages, give their
vote on proposals, judgements and quizzes, send feedback with emojis,
and share their feeling through challenge and mood indicators.
